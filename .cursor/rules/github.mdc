## Pre-Commit

### Security
**Ensure all API keys, absolute paths, and other secrets are removed from this repo BEFORE pushing!!!**
- Ensure [.gitignore](../../.gitignore) is up to date and robust
- .env files should always be excluded
- For this project, include the `.cursor` folder and its contents in commits. Do not exclude.

### Versioning
- If significant changes or feature additions have been made since the last tag, consider a minor version bump. Always consult with the user before bumping the version.

### QA
- Ensure ALL documentation is up to date, and accurately reflects the current state of the codebase. Always check:
  1. Main [README.md](../../README.md)
  2. Backend [README.md](../../src/notesmith/README.md)
  3. [SPECS.md](../../docs/SPECS.md)
  4. [ROADMAP.md](../../docs/ROADMAP.md)

If any documentation is NOT up-to-date, pause the commit process to update these files.

- While it should be updated during development, check the [dockerfile](../../backend/Dockerfile) and [docker-compose.yml](../../docker-compose.yml) to ensure it is up to date and will run the project as expected.
