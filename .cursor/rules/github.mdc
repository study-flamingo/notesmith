## Pre-Commit

### Test-Driven Development
All tests should pass before pushing to Github. If there are problematic tests, attempt to fix them BEFORE pushing. If after several tries a test still will not pass, or if there is a legitimate reason the test cannot pass in the current context, advise the user and ask if they would like to commit anyway.

### Security
**Ensure all API keys, absolute paths, and other secrets are removed from this repo BEFORE pushing!!!**
- Ensure [.gitignore](../../.gitignore) is up to date and robust
- .env files should always be excluded
- For this project, include the `.cursor` folder and its contents in commits. Do not exclude.

### Versioning
- If significant changes or feature additions have been made since the last tag, consider a minor version bump. Always consult with the user before bumping the version.

### QA
- Ensure ALL documentation is up to date, and accurately reflects the current state of the codebase. Always check:
  1. Main [README.md](../../README.md)
  2. Backend [README.md](../../src/notesmith/README.md)
  3. [SPECS.md](../../docs/SPECS.md)
  4. [ROADMAP.md](../../docs/ROADMAP.md)
- If any documentation is NOT up-to-date, pause the commit process to update these files.
- While it should be updated during development, check the [dockerfile](../../backend/Dockerfile) and [docker-compose.yml](../../docker-compose.yml) to ensure it is up to date and will run the project as expected.
- Look for any `TODO` lines or placeholders that are not meant for the end-user, and attempt to address these prior to commit.
